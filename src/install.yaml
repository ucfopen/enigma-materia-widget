    A Jeopardy-like study and quiz tool.
    Questions are separated into categorical
    rows.
  generation_prompt: >
    Each index in the outermost items array represents a subject matter category related to the overall topic, with individual
    questions contained within the inner items array for each category. Ideally, each category should contain roughly the same number
    of questions. For example, if eight questions are requested, there might be two categories with four questions each. Categories should be
    distinct sub-topics of the overall widget topic, and their corresponding questions should relate to the category sub-topic.
